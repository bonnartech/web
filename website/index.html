            <span>who is nivini?</span>
            <p>Previously known as "XCLO", he rebranded to "NIVINI" which he claims has a more authentic feel.
                His recent release 10000HRS potrays the young artist's creative capacity as he is credited for writing the song,laying and mixing the vocals, directing the video  and even going further to edit it into what you see on screen.
                You can question the talent but you got to give it to him for his work ethic.
                 After releasing a couple of singles in 2019 & 2020 and a short spell of collaborations with Nakuru based Romeezy and others,the rapper took a break to focus on honing his skill and finding his voice.He is back at it and it is pretty evident that the hiatus worked for his good.
                He claims to have amassed an impressive catalogue during that same period and is now ready to "feed the streets"</p>

        <span>blog post</span>
        <p>Yet another major release by rapper Nivini.Titled rythm and booze,this project brings to light the young artist's passion for his homecountry as he portrays a flourishing post independence Kenya.Accompanying the slides of film is a nostalgic feel with a laidback instrumental and calmly written lyrics.
            A huge advocate of the bare maximum(doing the most with the least you have)he takes it to the edge by recording and engineering the sound on a friends laptop using cheap equipment he sourced online and going on to edit raw stock free footage he stumbled upon on youtube on his old iphone 7.With no
            background in media or film this was purely a case of trial and error.Did it work out? You be the judge.Watch Rythm and booze(the short film).
